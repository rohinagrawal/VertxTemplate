# VertxTemplate Agent Guide

This repository keeps shared agent assets under `.agents/`.

The repo root `AGENTS.md` should stay as a thin compatibility file that points at this guide so tools that look for `AGENTS.md` get the same source of truth.

## Directory Layout

```

```

Keep durable assets in the tracked directories above. Put temporary payloads, draft prompts, MCP call arguments, and other throwaway artifacts under `.agents/workspace/` instead of the `.agents/` root.

## Shared Assets

- Shared rules: `.agents/rules/`
- Shared skills: `.agents/skills/`
- Shared MCP source: `.agents/mcp/` when this repo needs an agent-facing service
- Shared asset manifest: `.agents/manifest.json`
- Shared validation command: `python3 .agents/scripts/validate-agent-assets.py`
- Ephemeral session scratch: `.agents/workspace/` (see `.agents/workspace/README.md`)

Tool-specific folders such as `.codex/` and `.cursor/` should be thin adapters or symlinks to `.agents/` wherever possible. Avoid duplicating rule, skill, or MCP content in multiple tool folders.

When adding support for another agent surface, prefer the same pattern:

1. Keep shared instructions, skills, rules, tools, and MCP code under `.agents/`.
2. Expose the shared asset through that tool's native entrypoint or config.
3. Use a symlink or the smallest possible wrapper when the tool cannot read `.agents/` directly.
4. Keep tool-specific behavior in the adapter only when the tool genuinely needs it.
5. Update every applicable adapter for the asset in the same change.
6. Update `.agents/manifest.json` with the source path, docs, adapter coverage, and any exposed tool names.

If a subproject needs different instructions, add the closest scoped `AGENTS.md` for that subtree and keep it limited to the local override. The nearest `AGENTS.md` should be treated as the more specific instruction source for files under that subtree.

## Rules

Before working in this repo, read every rule file under `.agents/rules/*`.

Treat rules with `alwaysApply: true` as baseline instructions for every task. Use rules with `alwaysApply: false` when their title, description, or content matches the task.

## Manifest and Validation

`.agents/manifest.json` lists each shared guide, rule, skill, MCP server, config adapter, and the hosts that consume it. Keep this manifest current whenever adding, moving, or exposing an agent asset.

When changing a shared asset, update every applicable host adapter in the same change. `adapter_hosts` records which hosts need direct adapter coverage; omit a host only when it consumes the asset indirectly or the asset is genuinely not applicable to that host.

Run validation before reporting shared agent asset work complete:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mode adapters
```

For a full validation pass that also checks Python compile and Maven compile, run:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/validate-agent-assets.py
```

If you only need to inspect MCP startup behavior, use:

```bash
python3 .agents/scripts/validate-agent-assets.py --mode mcp
```

## Skills

For quick setup of this shared-agent layout in a new project, use:

- `.agents/skills/agents-bootstrap/SKILL.md`

The source of truth for skills is `.agents/skills/`. If a tool needs a separate install location or symlink, keep that as a thin adapter only.

## Self-Improvement Boundary

Do not make every application-code change trigger agent asset changes. Instead, when a shared asset is used and the workflow reveals friction, improve the closest shared asset that owns that behavior. Examples of real friction include slow or noisy output, fragile request construction, missing guards, unclear docs, stale templates, incorrect metadata, or repeated manual steps.
